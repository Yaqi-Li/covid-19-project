The results are the causal effect of each variable. The black line summary path plot showed the significant effect under country level. And the grey solid line in the model showed the significant causal effect of each state. And the dash line indicates the non-significant effect. And the output also includes the structure equation model for each state. The red solid line showed the significant positive effect and blue solid line represents the significant negative effect. Through the SEM model, we found that the effect of visit rate and mobility of person on increasing rate of coronavirus is nonsignificant across all 50 state. However, the different states showed different pattern of this effect. Thus, a clustering analysis is necessary for next step to figure out the state which have the possibility of reopening the city without dramatically changes of the transmission rate
